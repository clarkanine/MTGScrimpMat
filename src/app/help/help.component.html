<h2 class="mat-h2">*Attention*</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    This web application has only been run and tested on Google Chrome. The following instructions assume that is the browser it is 
    running on. That's not to say it <i>won't</i> work on other browsers, I just have yet to test and support them.
</p>

<h2 class="mat-h2">Setting up your players</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    Go to the Player List page from the menu on the left. If you haven't logged in to your own account, you won't see 
    your current players, so start adding them! Pressing the New Player button will bring up a dialog where you can 
    enter player information, including a deck list. The deck list <strong>must</strong> be formatted like the following 
    <br>
        4 Snapcaster Mage
    <br>
        4 Serum visions
    <br>
    .
    <br>
    .
    <br>
    .
    <br> 
    i.e. the quantity of the card followed by its name. MTGGoldfish and TappedOut have an easy way to get lists of 
    existing decks in this format. 
    <br><br>
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h2">Using the interface</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    Once you've added your players, navigate to the Current Game page from the menu on the left. Currently, MTGScrimp 
    supports two-player magic games. You can select a player from the drop down list of players that you just created. 
    Selecting a player will auto populate the form fields with information, as well as the corresponding deck list tab 
    in the content below. 
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h2">Saving player data</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    MTGScrimp is currently only capable of saving files locally. When you press the Save Player button, it will start 
    to download a file for each form field. 
    <br>
    <strong>Note: You will want to be able to download multiple files at once and have them overwrite existing files. 
            To do that, 
            checkout the Overwrite Downloads Extension and Configure Downloads links above. It is helpful to download 
            these files to a well named folder such as MTGScrimpTextFiles. 
    </strong>
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h2">Setting up OBS</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    Go ahead and click on the Save Player buttons for both of the players. You should see downloads for text files 
    named someting like player1life.txt. To get these showing on OBS, create a text source that reads from its corresponding 
    file that was created. Move them around until it looks pretty. Maybe you have a neat overlay to make 
    it real fancy. Try changing some life totals and pressing Save Player; it should save the values and show up 
    on your OBS window. 
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h2">Saving cards</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    If you have a reason to display a card image on your stream, you can do that pretty easily with MTGScrimp. If the active 
    players have deck lists, the cards will show up in their corresponding tabs in the bottom area. You can right-click on the 
    image and Save As (preferably to the folder that has your text files to keep things tidy). If your players don't have deck lists, 
    you can simply search for a card using the Card Search tab. Set up an Image Source in OBS from that file you just downloaded. 
    Under each card is a link to its oracle text in case you need clarification when a heated argument begins during a game. 
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h2">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="mat-p">
    This is a pet project of mine. I have a full time job, but I wanted to create this in my free time since I will use it myself.

<h2 class="mat-h2">So you want to stream paper MTG with OBS?</h2>
<p class="mat-p">You've come to the right place! When I first started watching Star City Games or Channel Fireball or other 
    pro MTG tournaments, I loved how crisp the layout looked. A buddy of mine at a local card shop decided to run
    his own stream. I played in the local tournaments, watching the stream from the sidelines and noticed it was
    very...bland. He literally had a webcam on a 5" tripod pointing at a table. No visuals on the stream either.
    He had to remind his audience of the life totals and play by plays orally. I saw room for improvement, and 
    thus, MTG Scrimp was born!
</p>
<h2 class="mat-h3">Setup</h2>
<p>Since MTG Scrimp is young, there are a lot of features that can be improved. But for the time being, 
  there are some relatively simple configurations you'll need/want in order to stream paper MTG effectively.
  First off, please use MTG Scrimp on Google Chrome. It is the browser I developed MTG Scrimp for and also
  happens to be my browser of choice.
</p>
<h3>'download link for google chrome'</h3>
<p>
  The text produced for your stream is going to be saved to files locally. Hopefully, OBS will end up supporting
  reading text from URLs and not just files, but for the meantime, we'll make do. Some helpful configurations will 
  be enabling Google Chrome to download multiple files at once. Also, specifying a new place for Google Chrome downloads 
  to go will make organizing your text files easier. Note that if you go to another site in the Chrome Browser and download 
  something, it will also go to that folder. Chrome easily lets you change your download folder.
</p>
<p>
  Since you'll probably be pressing 'Update' on the players a lot, you'll want your downloads to overwrite instead of putting 
  (#) at the end. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downloads-overwrite-alrea/lddjgfpjnifpeondafidennlcfagekbp">Here's an extension that does just that.</a>
</p>
<h3>'configure download settings in chrome'</h3>
<h3>Setting up OBS</h3>
<p>After configuring your Google Chrome download settings, the first thing you're going to want to do is navigate to 
  the 'Current Game' page. You can do this from the menu on the left side of the screen or by pressing 3 horizontal lines
  menu button.
  <br><br>
  Once there, go ahead and enter some values in both of the player forms and then press the 'Update Player' button underneath 
  each of the forms. This might start the download automatically, or if you've just setup the ability to download multiple files,
  you may be asked by Chrome if you'd like to allow this. Select whatever option pops up that lets you download multiple files
  at once. 
  <br><br>
  This next part is the most time consuming and I'm hopeful that I can make it easier in the future. Go into OBS and create
  'Text' sources for all of the values you want to display on screen (i.e. the fields available to change on the 'Current 
  Game' page). Name them something meaningful like 'player1life' or 'right_player_name' or whatever your favorite naming 
  convention is. Next, change the properties on each of these text to be able to 'Read from file'. On Mac, you can access 
  these properties by right clicking and selecting 'Properties' or by selecting the source and clicking the gear icon. Once 
  you've clicked the 'Read from file' checkbox, browse for the associated file that you just downloaded from MTG Scrimp.
  <br><br>
  You've now got everything setup! Move the values in OBS to wherever you'd like them to be on the screen! Maybe you even 
  have a nice overlay to put them on. Now you can make changes within MTG Scrimp, and pressing 'Update Player' will save 
  those changes which will then be seen by OBS.
